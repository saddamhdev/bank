# ❌ Why This Error Happens

```
Unable to find GatewayFilterFactory with name ApplicationDetails
```

Spring Cloud Gateway is trying to load a filter from YAML:

```yaml
filters:
  - ApplicationDetails
```

But it cannot find a class named:

```
ApplicationDetailsGatewayFilterFactory
```

---

# 🧠 Important Rule

When you write:

```yaml
- ApplicationDetails
```

Spring automatically searches for:

```
ApplicationDetailsGatewayFilterFactory
```

NOT:

* GlobalFilter
* Normal class
* Any random component

Only classes extending:

```java
AbstractGatewayFilterFactory
```

---

# 🚨 Why Your App Crashes

Most likely you created:

```java
ApplicationDetailsGlobalFilter
```

But in YAML you're using:

```yaml
- ApplicationDetails
```

That only works if you created:

```java
ApplicationDetailsGatewayFilterFactory
```

---

# ✅ SOLUTION 1 (Recommended)

If you already created a **GlobalFilter**, then:

👉 REMOVE this from YAML:

```yaml
filters:
  - ApplicationDetails
```

Because GlobalFilter applies automatically.

You DO NOT need to declare it in YAML.

✔ Fix
✔ Clean
✔ Production pattern

---

# ✅ SOLUTION 2 (If You Really Want Route-Level Filter)

Create this class:

```java
package snvn.gatewayservice.filter;

import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.GatewayFilter;
import org.springframework.cloud.gateway.filter.factory.AbstractGatewayFilterFactory;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Component;

@Component
public class ApplicationDetailsGatewayFilterFactory
        extends AbstractGatewayFilterFactory<Object> {

    public ApplicationDetailsGatewayFilterFactory() {
        super(Object.class);
    }

    @Override
    public GatewayFilter apply(Object config) {
        return (exchange, chain) -> {

            exchange.getRequest().mutate()
                    .header("X-App-Name", "gateway-service")
                    .build();

            return chain.filter(exchange);
        };
    }
}
```

Now YAML works:

```yaml
filters:
  - ApplicationDetails
```

# 🏆 What I Recommend For You

Since you are building:

Gateway → main-service → user-service

Use:

✔ GlobalFilter for logging, tracing, metadata
✔ Route filters only for special cases

---

# 🔥 Best Clean Architecture

Do this:

### 1️⃣ Keep this in Gateway:

```java
@Component
public class ApplicationDetailsGlobalFilter implements GlobalFilter
```

### 2️⃣ REMOVE this from YAML:

```yaml
- ApplicationDetails
```

Then restart.

Problem solved.

# 🎯 Why This Error Is Good

This means:

✔ Your Gateway is loading correctly
✔ YAML parsing works
✔ Only missing filter factory

* Proper difference between GlobalFilter vs GatewayFilterFactory
* Clean enterprise gateway structure
* How Netflix designs custom filters
* How to make filter configurable via YAML args
