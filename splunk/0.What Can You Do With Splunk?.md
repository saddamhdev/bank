Excellent question 👌
Since you already connected your **Spring Boot microservices → Splunk**, now let’s talk real value.

---

# 🔥 What Can You Do With Splunk?

Think of Splunk as:

> A search engine + analytics engine for logs & events.

You are no longer just “seeing logs”.
You can now **monitor, analyze, alert, audit, and debug production systems**.

---

# 🧠 1️⃣ Debug Faster (Microservices Tracing)

Because your logs include:

* traceId
* correlationId
* service name
* level
* exception

You can do:

### 🔎 Find full request journey

```spl
traceId="3272e295ef584e3580c1e06709a4c2fb"
```

You will see:

* Gateway log
* User-service log
* Transaction-service log
* All in one place

This is enterprise-grade distributed debugging.

---

# 📊 2️⃣ Monitor Errors Per Service

### 🔎 Count errors by service

```spl
index=main level=ERROR
| stats count by service
```

Now you know:

* Which service failing most?
* Which microservice unstable?

---

# 🚨 3️⃣ Create Alerts (Very Powerful)

Example:

> If ERROR > 10 in 1 minute → send alert

```spl
index=main level=ERROR
| stats count
```

You can configure:

* Email alert
* Webhook
* Slack
* SIEM forwarding

This is real production monitoring.

---

# 📈 4️⃣ Build Dashboards

You can create dashboard panels like:

| Panel                | Query                   |                           |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------- |
| Total Requests       | `index=main             | stats count`              |
| Error Rate           | `index=main level=ERROR | stats count`              |
| Service Distribution | `                       | stats count by service`   |
| Top Exceptions       | `                       | stats count by exception` |

Your own monitoring dashboard.

# 🔐 5️⃣ Audit & Security Monitoring

Since you're building banking/microservices:

You can track:

* Failed logins
* Suspicious activity
* High transaction volume
* Duplicate user creation
* Role changes
* Admin operations

Example:

```spl
service="auth-service" level=ERROR
```

---

# 📊 6️⃣ Performance Analysis

You can log execution time and analyze:

```spl
| stats avg(responseTime) by service
```

Now you know:

* Which API is slow?
* Which service is bottleneck?

---

# 🧬 7️⃣ Business Analytics From Logs

Example:

Count user registrations:

```spl
service="user-service" message="User created successfully"
| stats count
```

Count transactions per hour:

```spl
service="transaction-service"
| timechart count span=1h
```

---

# 🛡 8️⃣ Production Observability Stack

You now have:

* JSON structured logs
* MDC traceId
* Centralized logging
* Searchable microservices events

This is how:

* Banks
* Fintech
* Enterprise SaaS
* Government systems

monitor systems.

---

# 🚀 For Your Architecture (Based On Your Setup)

You have:

* gateway-service
* user-service
* transaction-service
* kafka-service
* rabbitmq-service
* auth-service

You can now:

✅ Monitor Kafka errors
✅ Monitor RabbitMQ failures
✅ Detect duplicate DB insert
✅ Track distributed trace
✅ Audit user operations
✅ Measure system health

---

# 🎯 In Simple Words

Splunk allows you to:

> See everything happening inside your system in one place, in real-time.
