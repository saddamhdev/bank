Modern banks design systems with **strict layers**, **strong security**, and **auditability**. Below is the **standard architecture** you’ll see in real banks—mapped to what **you can build**.

---

## 🧱 High-Level Layers (big picture)

```
Channels (Web / Mobile / ATM)
        ↓
API Gateway / WAF
        ↓
Auth & Access Layer
        ↓
Business Services (Microservices)
        ↓
Data Layer (Ledger-first)
        ↓
Messaging & Cache
        ↓
Observability & Audit (SIEM)
```

---

## 1️⃣ Channels (Customer Touchpoints)

**What users touch**

* Mobile Banking App
* Internet Banking (Web)
* ATM / POS
* Internal Banker Portal

**Key rules**

* Never talk to DB directly
* All calls go through APIs
* Rate-limited + monitored

---

## 2️⃣ API Gateway + WAF (Front Door)

**Purpose**

* Single entry point
* Security & traffic control

**Responsibilities**

* TLS termination
* Rate limiting
* IP allow/deny
* Request validation
* Routing

**Common tools**

* Apigee / Kong / NGINX
* Cloudflare (WAF)

---

## 3️⃣ Authentication & Authorization

**Bank-grade auth is not “just login”**

**Includes**

* Login (password / OTP / SSO)
* Device fingerprint
* Failed-attempt tracking
* Account lock
* Role-based access (RBAC)

**Outputs**

* Access token (short-lived)
* Session metadata

---

## 4️⃣ Business Services (Core Banking Logic)

This is where **real banking happens**.

### Typical microservices

* Customer Service (KYC)
* Account Service (CASA)
* Transaction Service
* Loan / EMI Service
* Payment Service
* Notification Service

**Golden rule**

> Services never trust balances—**they trust the ledger**.

---

## 5️⃣ Data Layer (Ledger-First Design)

**Most important banking concept**

### ❌ What banks avoid

* Updating balances directly
* Deleting transactions

### ✅ What banks do

* Append-only ledger
* Immutable records

```
ledger_entry
 ├─ account_id
 ├─ amount
 ├─ DEBIT / CREDIT
 ├─ reference
 └─ timestamp
```

**Balance = SUM(CREDIT) − SUM(DEBIT)**

---

## 6️⃣ Messaging & Caching

### 📨 Messaging (Async)

Used for:

* Payments
* Notifications
* Retries
* Audit events

**Tools**

* RabbitMQ / Kafka

### ⚡ Caching

Used for:

* Login attempts
* OTP
* Rate limits
* Session metadata

**Never cache**

* Ledger
* Money balances

---

## 7️⃣ Observability, Audit & SIEM

Banks must answer:

> **Who did what, when, from where?**

**Centralized logging**

* App logs
* Auth logs
* Transaction events
* Infra logs

**SIEM**

* **Splunk**

**Use cases**

* Fraud detection
* Brute-force alerts
* Compliance reports
* Incident investigation

---

## 8️⃣ Security & Compliance (Everywhere)

**Non-negotiable**

* TLS everywhere
* Encryption at rest
* Least privilege
* Audit trails
* No secrets in logs

**Compliance**

* PCI-DSS
* SOX
* ISO 27001
* Local central bank rules

---

## 🧠 Typical Bank Deployment (simplified)

```
Client
 → WAF / API Gateway
 → Auth Service
 → Core Banking Services
 → Ledger DB (PostgreSQL/Oracle)
 → Message Broker
 → Cache
 → SIEM (Splunk)
```

---

## 🧪 How THIS maps to what YOU’re building

You already have:

* Spring Boot (services)
* PostgreSQL (ledger-ready)
* Redis (login attempts, cache)
* RabbitMQ (async)
* Splunk (audit & monitoring)

You’re **on the right track**.

---

## 🎤 Interview-ready summary (say this)

> “A banking architecture is layered with channels, API gateway, authentication, core banking services, a ledger-first data model, async messaging, caching, and centralized SIEM for audit and security.”

---

## 🔜 Next steps (choose one)

1️⃣ **Draw the full architecture** for your banking project
2️⃣ **Design the ledger DB schema** (tables + rules)
3️⃣ **Authentication flow** (bank-grade)
4️⃣ **Transaction processing flow** (ACID + idempotency)
5️⃣ **Splunk dashboards for banking use cases**

Tell me the number and we’ll go deep 👍
